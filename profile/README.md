[originoid][originoid] is a multipurpose content sharing platform to share any type of work you throw at it, plus grouping them into characters, references, worlds, etc with full reupload detection by blocking bad-actors at the core and invisible watermarking on content.

this is a solo developed project by [dromzeh][dromzeh] since 2023 - various services in which originoid uses and relies on (not everything, as that'd be leaking secrets) are open source here for transparency!
